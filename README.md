GeoDjango is an included contrib module for Django that turns it into a world-class geographic Web framework. GeoDjango strives to make it as simple as possible to create geographic Web applications, like location-based services. Its features include:

Django model fields for OGC geometries and raster data.
Extensions to Django’s ORM for querying and manipulating spatial data.
Loosely-coupled, high-level Python interfaces for GIS geometry and raster operations and data manipulation in different formats.
Editing geometry fields from the admin.
